## Implemented Software

   IDE: Android Studio 2021.2.1.15
   
   JDK - Java 18
   
   Framework – Flutter 3.0.2 
   
   Database – Hive Db
   
   Version control – Github
   



## Future Update 

•	Authentication.

•	Cloud Storage.



## Challenges Faced 

•	Faced error into database issue.

•	Different kinds of framework version issue.

•	Faced not getting any data from user input.

•	Front end logical issue.

•	Faced Some Little bugs.



## Conclusion 

## Limitations:
Still there are some limitations to this Expense manager app. If I just want to go through a brief discussion then I can say that I could make the UI more attractive. We could add more features to this project.

•	It would be better if we could add time for each transaction.

•	If we could add cloud storage it will make better to get the data at any devices
.
I have found out the mentioned limitations above. I am so on it to meet those limitations and build a competitive application.


## Highlighting point:

•	User can make unlimited Transactions.

•	Users can delete any transaction at any time.

•	The UI is simple and minimal.

•	User can rename his/her name at any time.

## Future Scope

This project has achieved the objective of building simple application using flutter. The development of this project has been achieved by using dart and flutter which is becoming popular likely to be the choice of development for mobile app developers in the future. This project can be further extended as per as user requirements.
